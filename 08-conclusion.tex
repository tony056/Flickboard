\section{Conclusion}
%Final: 我覺得開頭應該改成這句強調main contribution
%To reduce hand movement between separate keyboards and touchpads, we build the first system capable of combining a trackpad and a keyboard into an single interaction area without the need for external switches. The system evaluation shows our automatic mode switching classification accuracies of 98\% are achievable with our technology. Futhermore, our system can be adapted to a new user only with small amount of training data (about 6 minutes).

We built a prototype to combine a trackpad and a keyboard into a single interaction area and designed a system that can automatically switch between trackpad mode and typing mode with very high accuracy. Furthermore, our system can be adapted to a new user only with small amount of training data (about 6 minutes). 
Currently, we only enable pointing and 2-finger scrolling gestures in trackpad mode. In the future, we are planning to implement a gesture recognizing system to recognize more multi-touch gestures, such as, swipe, and pinch to enable more functions on our system.

%we designed a system that can automatically detect users' intention of switching between pointing and typing with a real-time recognizer.

% In this work, we designed a keyboard add-on that is easy to install to enable touch capability on the regular keyboard.
% Our system can also automatically detect user's intention of switching between pointing and typing with a realtime recognizer.
% The proposed touch sensing technique has higher resolution over the previous works on performing gestures on keyboard, it can also be used for bimanual multitouch gestures or more.
